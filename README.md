# #brobots eco-project frontend

Renewed frontend for #brobots eco-project. Includes new UI and improved UX

## Project setup

### Install Parcel globally

or

`yarn global install parcel-bundler`

### Install dependencies

`npm i` or `yarn`

## Usage

### Run dev server

`npm start`

or

`yarn start`

`npm run build`

### Deploy project

You have to be whitelisted on the server and have credentials for it.

## For WSL users

I use WSL as my working system and I spent lots of time debugging this small thing: hot reload isn't working if your project is on Windows partition. Move the project to WSL part. It also works much faster there.
